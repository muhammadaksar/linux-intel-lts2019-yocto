Intel(R) Gaussian & Neural Accelerator (Intel(R) GNA)
=====================================================

Acronyms
========
GNA	- Gaussian & Neural Accelerator
GMM	- Gaussian Mixer Model
CNN	- Convolutional Neural Network
RNN	- Recurrent Neural Networks
DNN	- Deep Neural Networks

Introduction
============
The Intel GNA is an Internal PCI fixed device available on several Intel platforms/SoCs.
Feature set depends on the Intel Chipset SKU.

Intel GNA provides hardware accelerated computation for GMMs and Neural Networks.
It supports several layer types: affine, recurrent, and convolutional among others.
Hardware also provides helper layer types for copying and transposing matrices.

Linux Driver
============
Intel GNA driver is a pci driver as Intel GNA is a PCI device.
The driver also registers a character device to expose file operations via dev node.

The driver probes/removes PCI device, implements file operations, handles runtime
power management, and interacts with hardware through MMIO registers.

IOCTL
=====
Intel GNA driver controls the device through IOCTL interface.
Following IOCTL commands are supported:
       GNA_MAP_USRPTR lock user pages and GNA MMU setups for DMA transfer.
       GNA_UNMAP_USRPTR unlocks user pages and releases GNA MMU structures.
       GNA_SCORE submits a request to the device queue.
       GNA_WAIT blocks and waits on the submitted request.
       GNA_CPBLTS gets driver and device capabilities.

Notes
=====
- Intel GNA hardware can process one request at given time using FIFO queue.
- The driver locks user pages at GNA_MAP_USRPTR and keeps them locked until
  GNA_UNMAP_USRPTR is called from user space.
- Intel GNA driver supports more than one opened file.
